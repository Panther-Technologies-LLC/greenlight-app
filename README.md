Greenlight

Greenlight is an app which uses a model similar to tinder that provides investors and start-up companies a platform to connect. Greenlight was created by Panther Technologies using React in Rails, as a way to implement both a visual and intuitive user-friendly application. As an investor you are able to click through “pitch cards” created by Company accounts. If you stumble across a project you’d like to possibly invest in, you can “greenlight” the project to connect with the company’s rep. 

Key things our project can do is create 2 different types of user accounts(Start-Up Company/Investor), Create, Read, Edit, and Delete pitchcards, "greenlight" Company pitch cards, Maintain a list of "greenlit" pitch cards, and a contact form for communication.
